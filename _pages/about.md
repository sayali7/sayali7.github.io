Hi! I'm a computer science Ph.D. student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). I am advised by [Daifeng Wang](https://daifengwanglab.org/). My research interests broadly span interpretable machine learning for genomics, graph neural networks, attention models, and optimal transport. In particular, I work on building machine learning methods to understand biological mechanisms underlying diseases like Alzheimer's, and disease predictions from single-cell genomics.

Previously, I completed my undergrad at [Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) in computer engineering. I later completed my master's in computer science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Samir Das](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~samir/).
