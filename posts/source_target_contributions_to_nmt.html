<span style="font-size:15px;">
    In NMT, each prediction is based on two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sentence.
    We show how to evaluate the relative contributions of source and target to NMT predictions and find that:
<ul>
  <li>models suffering from exposure bias are more prone to over-relying on target history (and hence to hallucinating) than
  the ones where the exposure bias is mitigated;</li>
  <li>models trained with more data rely on the source more and do it more confidently;</li>
    <li>the training process is non-monotonic with several distinct stages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Influences the Predictions: Source or Target?</h3>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/two_types_of_context-min.png" style="max-width:55%; margin-left:20px;float:right;"/>

<p>NMT models (and, more generally, conditional language models) generate target sentence word by word, and
    at each step, they use two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sentence.

</p>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/question_what_influences-min.png" style="max-width:30%; margin-left:20px;float:right;"/>
<p>Intuitively, we may expect that some tokens are predicted based on mostly source information (informative tokens),
    while others
    are based mainly on target history (e.g. determiners). But how can we know which information the model used?
</p>
<p>So far, we could only look at the most important tokens <font face="arial">within</font> either source or target separately
    (e.g. by looking at attention weights or using more complicated methods).
    But there is no way to measure <font face="arial">the trade-off between the source and the target</font>.
</p>
<p>This is exactly what we will do! But first, let's understand why do we care about the source-target trade-off.</p>

<h4><u>Why do we care:</u> Hallucinations and beyond.</h4>
<h4>TL;DR: Models often fail to properly use these two kinds of information.</h4>


<p>The main reason for investigating the source-target trade-off is that
    NMT models often <font face="arial">fail to properly use these two kinds of information</font>.
        For example, context gates (which learn to weight source
        and target contexts) help for
        both RNNs and Transformers.
</p>
<p>A more popular and clear example is hallucinations, when a model produces
    sentences that are fluent but unrelated to the source.
    The hypothesis is that in this mode, a model ignores information from source and samples
    from its language model.
    While we do not know what forces a model to hallucinate in general, previous work showed
    some anecdotal evidence that when hallucinating, a model does fail to use source properly.
    Look at the examples of attention maps of hallucinating models: models may put most of the decoder-encoder attention
    to uninformative source tokens, e.g. EOS and punctuation.

    <p>While these examples are interesting, note that this evidence is rather anecdotal:
        these are only a couple of examples when a model is "caught in action" and even for the same Transformer model,
        researchers found different patterns.

<h2>Relative Contributions of Source and Target</h2>

<p>Note that when we ask what influences a prediction, we are
    interested not in some abstract quantity but in <font face="arial">relative</font> contributions.
    In simple words, imagine we have everything that took part in forming a prediction - let's call it
    "total contribution".
    What we are interested in is <font face="arial">the part of the total contribution</font>.
</p>


<h3>How: Use Layerwise Relevance Propagation</h3>

<p style="text-align: center; float: right; display: block;
        margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:25px; max-width:60%;">
            <img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/lrp_main-min.png" style="margin-bottom:15px;" width=100% alt="" /><br />
            <span style="font-size: small;">The figure is adapted from the one taken from
        <a href="http://danshiebler.com/2017-04-16-deep-taylor-lrp/" target="_blank">
                    Dan Shiebler's blog post</a>.</span></p>

<p>We show that a natural way to estimate how the source and target contexts
    contribute to generation is to apply
    <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130140">Layerwise
        Relevance Propagation (LRP)</a> to NMT models.
    LRP is one of the attributions method originally designed for computer vision models.
    In general, attribution methods try to identify those parts of the input (e.g. pixels in an input image)
    which contribute to a given prediction.

    Layerwise Relevance Propagation does this by recursively propagating a prediction through the network
    from the output to
    the input. While the prediction is formed in the forward pass, relevance propagation evaluates
    relevancies in the backward pass.
</p>

<h3>LRP is Unique: It Satisfies the Conservation Principle</h3>

<div style="font-size:18px;
border-left: 5px solid #b7db67;
    margin: 10px;
    margin-left: 20px;
    padding: 0px;
    background-color: #fafcf5;">
                <p class="data_text" style="margin-left: 10px;">In LRP, the total contribution is constant â‡’
                we can evaluate <strong>relative</strong> contributions.</p>
            </div>
<p>While there are many attribution methods with different properties,
    only LRP gives us a straightforward way to evaluate <font face="arial">relative</font>
    contributions.</p>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/lrp_conservation.gif" style="margin-left:20px;float:right;" width=50% alt="" />
<p> Differently from other methods estimating the influence of individual tokens,
    LRP evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence.
    It is possible because of its <font face="arial">conservation principle</font>:
    LRP redistributes relevance so that
    in each layer, the total contribution of all neurons is constant.
</p>

<h3>LRP for Conditional Language Models</h3>

<p>At first glance, it can be unclear how to apply a layer-wise method to a not completely layered architecture
    (such as encoder-decoder). However, this is rather straightforward and is done in two steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="arial">total relevance is propagated through the decoder</font><br>
        Since the decoder uses representations from the final encoder layer,
        part of the relevance "leaks" to the encoder; this happens at each decoder layer.</li>
    <li><font face="arial">relevance leaked to the encoder is propagated through the encoder layers.</font></li>
</ul>

    <p>The total contribution of neurons in each decoder layer is not preserved (part of the relevance leaks to the encoder),
        but the total contribution of all tokens â€“ across the source and the target prefix â€“ remains equal to the model prediction.
    </p>
<p>Look at the illustration: applying LRP at different generation steps,
we can now say which predictions are based on the source more (or less) than the others.

<h3>More Details on LRP â€“ Look at the Paper!</h3>
<p>In the paper, we also explain in detail the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="arial">formal description of how to propagate the relevance</font><br>
        In the paper, we provide formulas defining the rules for propagating a prediction back.
    </li>
    <li><font face="arial">the specific LRP variant</font><br>
    LRP has several variants; we use the one that keeps all contributions positive.
    </li>
    <li><font face="arial">how to extend LRP for Transformer</font><br>
    Since LRP has originally been designed for computer vision models, it is not directly applicable to the Transformer
        (e.g., attention layers). In the paper, we explain how we extend LRP for the Transformer.
    </li>
    <li><font face="arial">evaluating token relevance</font><br>
        Formally, we evaluate the relevance of input neurons to the top-1 logit predicted by a model.
        Then token relevance (or its contribution) is the sum of
        relevances of its neurons.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Experiments: Neural Machine Translation</h2>
<p>In the experiments, we analyze models trained on the WMT14 English-French dataset. We will vary
    the prefix on which the model is conditioned during generation (reference, model-generated or random),
    the training objective, the dataset size, and timesteps during model training.
    We will come to this very soon, but first, let me explain
    what we will be looking at.
</p>

<h4><u>We Look at</u>: Total Contribution and Entropy of Contributions</h4>
<p>We look at token contributions <font face="arial">for each generation step</font> separately. In this way, we'll
be able to see what happens during the generation process.
</p>
<video width=50% height="auto" style="margin-left: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px; float:right;" loop autoplay muted>
  <source src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/how_evaluate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
    total source contribution</font></p>
<p>The total contribution of source is the sum of contribution of source tokens.
    Note that since we evaluate relative contributions, \(contr(source) = 1 - contr(prefix)\).
</p>

<p><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
    entropy of contributions</font></p>
<p>The entropy of contributions tells us how 'focused' the contributions are:
whether the model is confident in the choice of relevant tokens or spreads its relevance across the whole input.
    In this blog post, we will see only entropy of source contributions, but in the paper,
    we do the same for target contributions.
</p>


<h4><u>We are Interested in</u>: General Patterns, i.e. Average Over a Dataset</h4>

<p>For individual predictions, relevance propagation can be inaccurate. For example,
it can underestimate small contributions; additionally, contributions of input elements (pixels, tokens, etc.) can
    differ little.
    Therefore, we look not at individual predictions but at <font face="arial">general patterns</font>.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/we_talk_about-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=80% alt="" />
</center>
<p>By "general patterns", we mean something that characterizes model behavior in general and not for a
    single example. For this, we take an average over an evaluation set. In each evaluation set, all source sentences,
    as well as all target sentences, have the same length. Look at the illustration.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/average_over_set-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=90% alt="" />
</center>

<p>Note also that we do not talk about absolute values of contributions (e.g., we <font face="arial">do not</font>
    say something of the kind
    <font class="data_text">"source contribution is usually x%"</font>),
    but how the general patterns change when varying training objectives, data amount, timestep in training, etc.
</p>


<br>
<h3>Getting Acquainted</h3>

<p>Before comparing different models,
     let us first get acquainted with the graphs:
    let's look at the results for a single model.</p>

<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     source contribution</font>: decreases during generation</h4>
<p>For each target position, the figure shows the source contribution. We see that, as the generation
progresses, the influence of source decreases (i.e., the influence of target increases).
     This is expected:  with a longer prefix,
    it becomes easier for the model to understand which source tokens to use,
    and at the same time, it needs to be more careful to generate tokens that agree with the prefix.

</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/general_source_influence-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=80% alt="" />
</center>
<p>Note also a large drop of source influence
    for the last token: apparently, to generate the EOS token, the model relies on prefix much
    more than when generating other tokens.</p>

<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     entropy of source contributions</font></h4>
<p>During generation, entropy increases until approximately 2/3 of the translation is generated,
    then decreases when generating the remaining part. Interestingly, for
    the last punctuation mark and the EOS token, entropy of source contributions is very high:
    the decision to complete the sentence requires a broader context.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/general_src_entropy-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=90% alt="" />
</center>

<!--
<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     entropy of target contributions</font></h4>
<p>Entropy of target contributions increases, which is expected since the prefixes are getting longer.
This means that the model does use longer contexts in a non-trivial way.
</p>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/general_src_entropy-min.png" style="margin-left:20px;float:right;" width=60% alt="" />

<br>
<h3>Reference, Model and Random Prefixes</h3>

<p>Now, let us look at the changes in these patterns when conditioning on different types of target prefixes:
reference, model translations, and prefixes of random sentences.</p>

<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     model-generated prefixes:</font> the simpler ones</h4>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/model_trs_are_simpler-min.png" style="margin-left:20px;float:right;" width=65% alt="" />

<p>First, let us compare how models react to prefixes that come from reference and model translations.
We know that beam search translations are usually simpler than references: several papers show that they contain
    fewer rare tokens, have less reorderings and are simpler syntactically.
</p>

<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/prefix_model_vs_reference-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=90% alt="" />
</center>

<p>When conditioned on these simpler prefixes, the model relies on the source more and is more
confident when choosing relevant source tokens (the entropy of source contributions is lower). We hypothesize that
    these simpler prefixes are more convenient for the model, and they require less reasoning on the target side.
</p>


<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     random prefixes:</font> the unexpected ones</h4>
<p>Now, let us give a model something unexpected: prefixes of random sentences. In
this experiment, a model has a source sentence and a prefix of the target sentence, which do not make sense
    together.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/random_prefix_example-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=75% alt="" />
</center>

<p>On the one hand, sometimes NMT models switch to a <font face="arial">hallucination mode</font>:
they ignore the source and generate from their language mode. As a result, they generate sentences
    that are fluent but unrelated to the source. On the other hand, language models can
    ignore a gibberish prefix: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10617">this cool
    paper investigating the exposure bias</a>
    reported this <font face="arial">self-recovery ability</font> of LMs.

            </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p><font face="arial">What will our model do: ignore the source or the prefix?</font>
    According to previous work, it can do either!</p>
<p>
    As we see from the results, the model tends to fall into hallucination mode even when a random prefix
    is very short, e.g.
    one token: we see a large drop of source influence for all positions.
    This
    behavior is what we would expect when a model is hallucinating, and there is no self-recovery ability.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/random_prefix_source_contribution-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=65% alt="" />
</center>

<p>Next, we see that with a random prefix, the entropy of contributions is very high and is roughly constant across
    positions. This is expected: a model can not understand which source tokens are useful to continue a random prefix.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/random_prefix_entropy-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=65% alt="" />
</center>


<br>
<h3>Exposure Bias and Source Contributions</h3>
<p>The results we just saw
    agree with some observations made in previous work studying self-recovery and hallucinations.
    Now, we illustrate more explicitly how our methodology can be used to shed light on the effects of
    exposure bias and training objectives.
</p>

<p><font face="arial">Exposure bias</font>
    means that in training, a model sees only gold prefixes, but at test time, it
    uses model-generated prefixes (which can contain errors).

    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10617">This ACL 2020 paper</a> suggests that there is a connection
    between the hallucination mode and
    exposure bias: the authors show that Minimum Risk Training (MRT), which does not suffer from exposure bias,
    reduces hallucinations. However, they did not directly measure the over-reliance on target history.
    Luckily, now we can do this :)
</p>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/exposure_bias_lets_measure-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=100% alt="" />

<h4><u>How</u>: Feed Different Prefixes, Look at Contributions</h4>

<p>We want to check to what extent models that suffer from exposure bias to differing extent are prone to hallucinations.
    For this, we feed different types of prefixes,
    prefixes of either model-generated translations or random sentences, and look at model behavior.
    While conditioning on model-generated prefixes shows what happens in the standard setting at model's inference,
    random prefixes (fluent but unrelated to source prefixes) show
    whether the model is likely to fall into a
    language modeling regime, i.e., <font face="arial">to what extent it ignores the source and hallucinates</font>.
</p>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/exposure_bias_models-min.png"
     style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:20px;float:right;" width=40% alt="" />
<p>In addition to the baseline and the models trained with the Minimum Risk Training objective (considered in previous work),
    we also experiment with word dropout. This is a data augmentation method: in training, part of tokens are replaced with
    random. When used on the target side, it may serve as the simplest way to alleviate exposure
    bias: it exposes a model to something other than gold prefixes.
    This is not true when used on the source side, but for analysis, we consider both variants.

</p>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/mrt_all_prefixes_src_contribution-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=100% alt="" />

<p>The results for both types of prefixes confirm our hypothesis:
</p>
<div style="font-size:18px;
border-left: 5px solid #b7db67;
    margin: 10px;
    margin-left: 20px;
    padding: 0px;
    background-color: #fafcf5;">
                <p class="data_text" style="margin-left: 10px;">
                    Models suffering from exposure bias are more prone to over-relying
                    on target history (and hence to hallucinating)
        than those where the exposure bias is mitigated.</p>
            </div>

<p>Indeed, we see that MRT-trained models ignore source less
    than any other model; the second best for random prefixes is the target-side word dropout, which also reduces exposure bias.
</p>


<p>It is also interesting to look at the entropy of source contributions to see whether these objectives
    make the model more or less "focused". We see that only MRT leads to more confident contributions
    of source tokens: the entropy is lower. In contrast, both word dropout variants teach
    the model to use broader context.

<h3>Varying the Amount of Data</h3>
<h4>TL;DR: With more data, models use source more and do it more confidently.</h4>

<p>We know that a large amount of training data is very important for NMT models to perform well.
    But how the amount of training data influences contributions?
</p>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/data_amount_both-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=100% alt="" />
<p>First, we see that, generally, models trained with more data use source more.
   Second, with more training data, the model becomes more confident in the choice of important tokens: the entropy
    of contributions becomes lower (in the paper, we also show entropy of target contributions).</p>

<h3>Training Process: Non-Monotonic with Several Distinct Stages</h3>
<p>Finally, let's look at what happens during model training. All results are summarized in the figure below;
    on the x-axis are the number of training batches.
</p>

<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/timeline-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=90% alt="" />
</center>

<p>Now, let's go over all these results one by one.</p>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/contributions_converge_early_v2-min.png"
     style="margin-left:20px;float:right;" width=40% alt="" />

<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     contributions converge early</font></h4>

<p>First, we look at how fast the contributions converge. For this, we evaluate KL
divergence between token influence distributions of the final converged model and the one in training.
</p>

<p>The figure shows that contributions converge early. After approximately 12k batches,
   the model is very close to its final state in the choice of tokens to rely on for a prediction:
    everything that happens after that is just refining the model.
</p>


<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     changes in contributions are non-monotonic</font></h4>
<p>The figures below show changes in the amount and entropy of contributions (average over examples and positions).
    We see that the changes are not monotonic, and different stages can be seen clearly.
    This means that something qualitatively different is going on during model training, and
    we hope that someone (maybe you?) will look into this further.
</p>
<center>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/changes_are_not_monotonic-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=85% alt="" />
</center>
<p>Look at the changes in the entropy of contributions: it goes down, then up. We hypothesize that
   first, the model learns something very simple (e.g. word-by-word translation): this is when the entropy goes
    down. Then, the model learns more complicated stuff and uses broader contexts.
</p>

<h4><span style="margin-right:15px;">&#8226;</span><font face="arial">
     early positions change more </font> (and are learned first)</h4>
<p>Previously we looked at the changes on average over all positions. Now, let's look at all positions.
In the figures, we show a separate line for each checkpoint; each line shows the entropy of source contributions for each
target position, and the lines are colored based on the checkpoint number.
</p>
<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/stages_with_positions-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=100% alt="" />

<p>We see that early positions change more: they are the ones where the entropy goes down
    most at the first stage and the ones where it goes up most in the second stage. Only at the last stage, when
    very little is going on, all positions change approximately the same.
</p>

<p>In the paper, we also show that early positions are learned first: at the end of the
first stage, per-token predictive accuracy at the early target positions is the highest.
</p>

<h4><font face="arial">Relation to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis</font></h4>

<p>Interestingly, our stages agree with the ones found by
    <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hkl1iRNFwS">Frankle et al, 2020</a>
    for ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10 when investigating, among other things,
    <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJl-b3RcF7">the lottery ticket hypothesis</a>.
Their stages were defined based on the changes in gradient magnitude,
    in the weight space, in the performance, and in the effectiveness of rewinding in search of
    the 'winning' subnetwork (for more details on the lottery ticket hypothesis and the rewinding,
    see e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01611">this paper</a>).
</p>

<img src="../resources/posts/src_dst_nmt/our_vs_frankle-min.png" style="margin-bottom:20px;" width=100% alt="" />

<p>Comparing those stages with ours, first, we see that their
    relative sizes in the corresponding timelines match well. Second, the rewinding starts to be effective
    at the third stage; for our model, this is when the contributions have almost converged.
    In future work, it would be interesting to look into this relation further.
</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Let's summarize what you just saw:</p>
<ul>
    <li>we showed how to use LRP to evaluate the relative contribution of source and target to NMT predictions;</li>
    <li>we analyzed how the contribution of source and target changes when conditioning on different
        types of prefixes: reference, generated by a model or random translations;</li>
    <li>we found that (i) models suffering from exposure bias are more prone to over-relying on target
        history (and hence to hallucinating), (ii) with more data, models rely on source information more
        and have more sharp token contributions, (iii) the training process is non-monotonic with several
        distinct stages.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>I think the best possible answer is <font face="arial">"It's up to you"</font> :)
</p>
<p>But you want our opinion, we do have some ideas
how this can be useful. For example,</p>
<ul>
    <li><font face="arial">measure how different training regimes change contributions</font><br>
        Some method claims to reduce exposure bias?
        That's great - now you can measure if it indeed increases contribution of source.
    </li>

    <li><font face="arial">look deeper into a model's pathological behavior</font><br>
        Something strange is going on in your network?
        On the one hand, this is not so great. But on the other, you can look at how contributions behave - this can
        not be boring!
    </li>
    <li><font face="arial">look further into training stages</font><br>
    You care more about language? Then you may look into the training stages from the language perspective:
        which patterns a model learns at each of them? Alternatively, you can investigate
        the connection between our stages and the ones from previous work.
    </li>

</ul>
